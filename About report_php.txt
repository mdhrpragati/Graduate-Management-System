About report.php (Report section: main page)

-Selects course_code and class_id from table "student_grade"
-Using a loop, it creates separate arrays containing duplicate course_code and class_id(using extract on an associative array)
-Again using array_unique(), it creates an array containing non-duplicate course_codes
-Then it breaks the "class_id" into batch and semester using the function substr() and similarly creates separate arrays containing non-duplicate batch and semesters
-There are three forms for: Individual Reports, Subjectwise Reports and Classwise Reports which are redirected to pages individual.php, subjectwise.php and classwise.php respectively.
-The select boxes for all the three forms are filled using the data that was gathered earlier.

About individual.php (Report section: Generating Individual Reports Section)
-Checks to see if the entered registration number is present in the database
-If the reg_no is present, then it makes an array of associative arrays of the grades and the rest in the "student_grade" table
-Then it extracts the information about the student with the given reg_no from the "student" table
-It then obtains an array containing non-duplicate class_ids to get the semester
-Using the obtained array, it produces another array of semesters which then is used to generate the grade report of each semester of the student.

About subjectwise.php (Report section: Generating Subjectwise Reports Section)
-It selects all the records from "student_grade" table that have the course_code and class_id given to it by the previous form
-It puts them in another array "Grade[]";
-It selects the student first_name, middle_name, last_name from "student" table.
-It loops until all the students in the course have been listed in the table.

About classwise.php (Report section: Generating Classwise Reports Section)
-The class_id is constructed using the batch and the semester and then used to select all the records from "student_grade" that have the class_id
-Then it creates a multi-dimentional array of the records that have been selected
-Using this multidimentional array, sorted arrays of course_code and registration numbers are made
-Then a loop is run for each of the registration numbers and a table row is created for the record

Problems in result section:
-Forgot to check if the student info is there or not, so errors are occuring
-If the grade has not been assigned, "Not assigned" can be displayed
-It is not clear if the student is enrolled in a course in the classwise report
