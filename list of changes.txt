Things done:

1. Added (padding-bottom:10px) in "hero-unit" class of bootstrap.css
2. When going into index.php after being logged in, redirecting to respective page.
3. Comment out line 4620 of bootstrap.css (line says: background-color: transparent)
4. Including "session.php" in each secured page to make sure that the page is not directly accessed
5. Edited the "adminpassword.php" so that it checks the old password as well
6. Repaired new_user.php

Tasks to do:

1. Check that only admin is able to view the admin pages and other users aren't
2. PROBLEM: What if the admin creates a class that has already been created???
	->Currently the code just simply adds that record into the database
3. Also the code does not check for duplicate courses during adding a new course to the semester
4. The nav bar does not show which page we are currently on. 
	--- We can solve this by making the navbar a function
5. We need a confirmation(probably javascript) before deleting anything (course/student details/etc)
6. When a course is deleted, the record referencing it in the "class" table should also be removed.
7. edit_course is still remaining(While trying to edit a course, you get a description of the course rather than an EDIT form)
