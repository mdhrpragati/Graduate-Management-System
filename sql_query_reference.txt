SELECT:
	SELECT [fieldnames] 
	AS [alias]
	FROM [tablename] 
	WHERE [criteria] 
	ORDER BY [fieldname to sort on] [DESC]
	LIMIT [offset, maxrows]
You can set numerous other parameters, but these are the most commonly used:
	- SELECT [fieldnames]: First decide what specific fieldnames you want to retrieve; if you want
to see them all, you simply insert *.
	- AS: You use the alias to group two or more fieldnames together so that you can reference them
later as one giant variable. An example would be:
SELECT first_name, last_name AS full_name. . . ORDER BY full_name . . .
You cannot use the AS parameter with the WHERE parameter, because this is a limitation of MySQL.
When the WHERE clause is executed, the column value may not be known.
	- FROM: This is pretty self-explanatory: You just need to name the table or tables you are pulling
the data from.
	- WHERE: List your criteria for filtering out the data, as described in the following section. 
	- ORDER BY: Use this parameter if you want the data sorted on a particular field; if you want the
results returned in descending order, add DESC.
	- LIMIT: This enables you to limit the number of results returned and offset the first record
returned to whatever number you choose. An example would be:
LIMIT 9, 10


Referencing Two Tables:
	$query = “SELECT customers.name, orders.order_total
	FROM customers, orders
	WHERE customers.cust_ID = orders.cust_ID”;
	//retrieves customers’ names from customers table and order_total from 
	//orders table where the cust_ID field in the customers table equals the
	//cust_ID field in the orders table. 

JOINing tables
	$query = “SELECT movie_name, movietype_label “ .
	“FROM movie “ .
	“LEFT JOIN movietype “ .
	“ON movie_type = movietype_id “ .
	“WHERE movie.movie_year>1990 “ .
	“ORDER BY movie_type”;

INSERTing into Tables

	$type = “INSERT INTO movietype (movietype_id, movietype_label) “ .
	“VALUES (1,’Sci Fi’), “ .
	“(2, ‘Drama’), “ .
	“(3, ‘Adventure’), “ .
	“(4, ‘War’), “ .
	“(5, ‘Comedy’), “ .
	“(6, ‘Horror’), “ .
	“(7, ‘Action’), “ .
	“(8, ‘Kids’)”;

UPDATEing tables

	$update = “UPDATE movie SET “ .
	“movie_running_time=102, “ .
	“movie_cost=10, “ .
	“movie_takings=15 “ .
	“WHERE movie_id = 1”;
